Conclusion: They migrated to Fastly, bye-bye Cloudflare.

--- 

__tldr: Cloudflare contacted them and had several sales calls. They want them to pay 120k/year for no reason. When they switched to Fastly, Cloudflare deactivated their account / DNS records causing huge downtime in their core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in their internal systems.__
