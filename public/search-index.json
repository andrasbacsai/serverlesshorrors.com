Yes, [me](https://x.com/heyandras), who owns this site. haha\n\nMintlify is great. This post is not against them or their product. I just would like to share this story so others could learn from it.\n\nMintlify sponsored [Coolify](https://coolify.io/ref=serverlesshorrors.com) a few months ago (because of [this](https://x.com/dobroslav_dev/status/1765825569281757289?s=46)) to be on their Startup/Pro tier for a year. I said yes, because it was great for the community / users. The docs got improvements from a UI/UX point of view.\n\nAfter a while, we realized that people REALLY use Coolify's docs and it costs a lot __(1M views / month)_\n\n## Why?\n\nThey have an AI feature that you could use to ask anything about the documentation. Sounds nice right? Yes it is, but from a cost point of view, it is risky.\n\n\nWhat if your users asks a lot of questions? What if someone just wants to talk to the AI companion? What if someone would like to scam you?\n\n\nAfter this realization, we agreed to disable this feature for now - they disabled it on their side, or not?!\n\nMonths went by, and one day, I woke up to a $400 bill. Woah.\n(btw, this is plus to your monthly plan, which is $150/month)\n\n## Okay, it was billed by mistake, but still.\n\nWho wants to woke up to a huge bill for their documentation site? Well, not me.\n\n\nI reached out to Mintlify support, and they said they will refund me. (Thank you!)\n\nBut in the meantime, I migrated Coolify to a self-hosted solution from [Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/) on [live-stream](https://heyandras.dev/live).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlways check parts of a service that you cannot turn off and it involves features that are based on usage.\n\n\n"},{"slug":"netlify-104k","category":"all","title":"$104,500.123","description":"So I received an email from Netlify last weekend saying that I have a $104,500.00 bill overdue...","tags":["netlify","bandwidth","ddos"],"body":"\n--- \n\n[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b14bty/netlify_just_sent_me_a_104k_bill_for_a_simple/)  \n\nConclusion: Netlify CEO confirmed -> won't be charge.\n\n--- \n\n__tldr: DDOS attack caused a spike in bandwidth usage ($104,500 / 4 days).__\n\nQuote from the victim:\n\n> So I received an email from Netlify last weekend saying that I have a $104,500.00 bill overdue. At first I thought this is a joke or some scam email but after checking my dashboard it seems like I am truly owing them 104K dollars:\n\n> That's 190TB bandwidth in 4 days\n\n> So I was like ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… and think okay maybe I got ddos attacked. Since Netlify charges 55$/100GB for the exceeding bandwidth, the peak day Feb 16 has 33385/55 * 100GB = 60.7TB bandwidth in a day. I mean, it's not impossible but why attack a simple static site like mine? This site has been on Netlify for 4 years and is always okay with the free tier. The monthly bandwidth never exceeded even 10GB, and has only ~200 daily visitors.\n\n> I contacted their billing support and they responded me that they looked into it and the bandwidth came from some user agents, meaning it is a ddos attack. Then they say such cases happen and they usually charge their customer 20% on this. And since my amount is too large, they offer to discount to 5%, which means I still need to pay 5 thousand dollars.\n\n> This feels more like a scam to me. Why do serverless platforms like Netlify and Vercel not have ddos protection, or at least a spend limit? They should have alerted me if the spending skyrocketed. I checked my inbox and spam folder and found nothing. The only email is \"Extra usage package purchased for bandwidth\". It feels like they deliberately not support these features so that they can cash grab in situations like this.\n\n> The ddos attack was focused on a file on my site. Yes it's partly my fault to put a 3.44MB size sound file on my site rather than using a third-party platform like SoundCloud. But still this doesn't invalidate the point of having protection against such attacks, and limit the spending.\n\n> I haven't paid that $5k yet and decided to post here to hear what others think first. And yes I have migrated my site to Cloudflare. Learned my lesson and will never use Netlify (or even Vercel) again."},{"slug":"vercel-23k","category":"all","title":"$23,000.420","description":"What is happening?!
